# Chapter 7: Making Vim Your Own

## .vimrc

See `../Chapter01/README.md` for copying instructions, `../Chapter02/README.md`
for a bit about comments, and `../Chapter03/README.md` for vim-plug download
instructions.

Some sections of the `.vimrc` are commented out: you're expected to uncomment them as you go through this chapter.

## .tmux.conf

This is a tmux configuration file. You don't need it for tmux to work, but it
offers some highly customized key bindings. You'll want to move the file to
your home directory: `~/.tmux.conf`.

## .screenrc

This is a screen configuration file which fixes a few issues Vim has when
working with GNU Screen. Copy it to your home directory if you decide to use
Screen: `~/.screen`.
